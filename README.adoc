= Toreman

Toreman is a one'ish-line shell script https://github.com/ddollar/foreman[foreman] clone that is running processes in separate https://github.com/tmux/tmux[tmux] panes.

With tmux, interleaved output, and interactive debugging are not a problem anymore.

It's also possible to selectively stop/restart processes.

== Usage

Run `toreman`, it will parse your `Procfile` and run each entry in a separate horizontal split.

Use C-b h/j to navigate between panes, and C-b z to toggle full-screen zoom.

== Installation

If you're on macOS and are using https://brew.sh/[Homebrew], it's as easy as:

[source,shell]
----
brew install pirj/homebrew-toreman/toreman
----

Otherwise, drop the `toreman` binary somewhere on your `$PATH`, or add an alias in your `rc` file:

[source,shell]
----
alias toreman="grep --invert-match '#' < Procfile | sed -e 's/^[^:]*: //' | xargs -I {} tmux split-window -v \; send-keys '[ -s .env ] && source .env; {}' 'C-m' && tmux select-pane -t 1 \; send-keys 'C-d' \; select-layout even-vertical"
